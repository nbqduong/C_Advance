Viết tắt:  American National Standards Institute (ANSI)

1983 ANSI formed X3J11 committee that developed first ANSI C known as C89, based on the standard UNIX C compiler of the time
1990  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) created C90
ISO created C99 standar
C11 is ANSI C specification
C11 includes several changes to C99:
-- Alignment specification (_Alignas specifier, _Alignof operator, aligned_alloc function, <stdalign.h> header file)
-- The _Noreturn function specifier and the <stdnoreturn.h> header file
-- Type-generic expressions using the _Generic keyword. For example, the following macro cbrt(x) translates to cbrtl(x), cbrt(x) or cbrtf(x) depending on the type of x:
-- Multi-threading support (_Thread_local storage-class specifier, <threads.h> header including thread creation/management functions, mutex, condition variable and thread-specific storage functionality, as well as the _Atomic type qualifier and <stdatomic.h> for uninterruptible object access).
-- Improved Unicode support based on the C Unicode Technical Report ISO/IEC TR 19769:2004 (char16_t and char32_t types for storing UTF-16/UTF-32 encoded data, including conversion functions in <uchar.h> and the corresponding u and U string literal prefixes, as well as the u8 prefix for UTF-8 encoded literals).
-- Removal of the gets function, deprecated in the previous C language standard revision, ISO/IEC 9899:1999/Cor.3:2007(E), in favor of a new safe alternative, gets_s.
-- Anonymous structures and unions, useful when unions and structures are nested, e.g. in struct T { int tag; union { float x; int n; }; };.
